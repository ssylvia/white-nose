      "text" : "The big brown bat is found in virtually every American habitat ranging from timberline meadows to lowland deserts, though it is most abundant in deciduous forest areas. It is often abundant in suburban areas of mixed agricultural use. This species ranges from extreme northern Canada, throughout the United States and south to the extreme southern tip of Mexico. Traditionally, these bats have formed maternity colonies beneath loose bark and in small cavities of pine, oak, beech, bald cypress and other trees. Common maternity roosts today can be found in buildings, barns, bridges, and even bat houses. Small beetles are their most frequent prey, yet big brown bats will consume prodigious quantities of a wide variety of night-flying insects."

Yet, despite this rather wide distribution, few maternity colonies have been discovered outside of Florida. This bat uses a variety of roosts in a variety of habitats including hollow trees in forested areas but also bridges, buildings, and culverts. Southeastern myotis are most commonly associated with caves, where they form large maternity colonies, sometimes containing thousands of individuals."

It has a tiny foot, short forearm, flat skull and keeled calcar. Little data is available. The single young are born May-July in nursery colonies of 12 to 20 bats sometimes found in buildings. The hardiest species are found in caves/mines of eastern North America, though they generally roost on the ground under rocks, in crevices/occasionally in buildings and under tree bark."

In the West it is found mainly in mountainous and riparian areas in a wide variety of forest habitats; from tree-lined xeric-scrub to aspen meadows and Pacific Northwest coniferous rain forests. This species is especially associated with humans, often forming nursery colonies containing hundreds, sometimes thousands of individuals in buildings, attics, and other man-made structures."

It is found in dense forest stands and chooses maternity roosts beneath exfoliating bark and in tree cavities, much like the Indiana myotis. And, like the Indiana myotis, the Northern myotis relies upon caves and underground mines for hibernation sites, where it typically chooses cooler sites than eastern pipistrelles and little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus)."

      "text" : "The Indiana myotis was one of the first bat species in the United States to be recognized as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Endangered Species Act. This listing was largely due to declines recorded at winter hibernation sites in caves, which, until very recently, were the only known roosts for this species. It is now known that in summer, Indiana myotis roost and rear their young under loose bark or in tree hollows. They are found throughout the Eastern United States from the central Midwest and upper New England states, south to the northern Gulf States and into extreme northern Florida. In winter, the largest hibernating populations of Indiana myotis occur in just three states: Kentucky, Missouri, and Indiana, where they form large, highly vulnerable aggregations. Human disturbance and alteration of hibernation caves, loss of summer roosting and foraging habitat due to deforestation, and pesticide poisoning have all contributed to the decline of the Indiana myotis."

Cave myotis are aerial insectivores and feed on a wide variety of insects including moths, weevils, antlions, small beetles and flying ants. Because these bats congregate in large groups, they are very susceptible to human disturbance."

These bats are among the first bats to emerge at dusk each night, and their appearance at tree-top level indicates that they may roost in foliage or in high tree cavities and crevices."

Exceptionally cold and warm caves are necessary for hibernation and for the rearing of young, respectively."
